# Hello, I'm <span class="name">Tim Uruski</span>

## I create computer software.

I love how computer programs are designed. Since I first began using a computer
as a child, I wanted to blend visuals and code together to make beautiful
software.  I think about it all the time. I read books about programming, even
languages I don't know. I collect and study software made by others so I can
understand how it's made down to the smallest detail. I have a
[resume](/resume/), if you're interested in my work experience. 

## I build solid wood furniture by hand.

When I need a break from all the abstractions of programming, I like to make
furniture out of solid wood. To keep all ten fingers, I mostly use hand tools
and techniques from the 19th century. This is a new hobby and I still have a
lot to learn. Wood is a complicated material with subtleties and nuances to be
mastered. It's a completely different challenge from writing code. Building
something to last for a hundred years is especially thought provoking.

## I cook meals without a recipe.  

Before moving out on my own, I taught myself how to cook. For dinner, I usually
cobble together whatever's in the pantry and fridge. The results are (almost)
always delicious and I enjoy tweaking the flavor as it develops. When I want to
learn a new technique, I gather a bunch of recipes together to see what they
share and how they differ. This helps me understand the role each ingredient
and step plays in the final product.

## I ride my bike in the summer.

To stay in shape, I ride my bike. I like the way a bike combines the human form
with a simple but powerful machine to travel far and fast with so little
effort. I've taught myself some basic bike maintenance to keep things running
smoothly, but it's also given me an appreciation for how mechanical things
work.
