# Hello, I'm <span class="name">Tim Uruski</span>

This is a resume outlining the past 9 years of my experience as a programmer.
Recruiters, please avert your eyes.

## Professional Experience

### Fanhattan <span class="duration">2010 &mdash; Present</span>

At [Fanhattan](http://fanhattan.com) I have been able to focus on software
development using **Ruby**, **MongoDB** and a bunch of other technologies. I
had the privilege of working with [Pivotal Labs](http://pivotallabs.com) for
six months, learning about test-driven development and agile programming.

### Corbis <span class="duration">2009 -- 2010</span>

Wanting to diversify my programming skills, I applied for a smaller, less
focused job as a web programmer for [Corbis](http://www.corbisimages.com/).
There I was able to re-learn **JavaScript** and some light **PHP** and I was
also lucky to develop an [iPad
application](http://www.veer.com/ideas/activitybook/) using WebKit.

### Critical Mass <span class="duration">2006 -- 2009</span>

I took a job as a Flash developer at [Critical Mass](http://criticalmass.com)
so I could focus on programming. For the next three years, I designed
and built front-end website frameworks in **ActionScript** for Dell, Rolex and
Budweiser. Teamwork was an important part of my job, and I learned a lot
about leadership and mentoring as senior developer.

### Ground Level Design <span class="duration">2003 -- 2006</span>

Freshly graduated from the New Media program at SAIT, I worked at Ground Level
Design for three years as a general developer. There I learned about web
standards and focused on my programming skills in Flash, building small widgets
and applications.

## Personal Experience

### Programming languages

I love learning about programming, and strive towards being a polyglot. I try
to learn a new language each year. My recent focus has been on Haskell and
Node.js. I also try to maintain an awareness of the endless list of open-source
libraries available. Studying the source code for these libraries also helps me
better understand the domains they wrap.

### Development environment

I do all of my work on a **Mac** because it provides a powerful blend of
graphical interfaces and linux shell. All of my work is stored in **Git**, much
of it on [GitHub](https://github.com/timuruski). More than almost any other
tool, it has improved the way I think about and do my work. Over the last few
years I've been moving towards a minimalist development environment based on
unix tools, shell programming and the Vim text editor.

### Autodidactyly

Most of my skills are self taught. During college I wanted to learn more about
programming, which was not a big part of the curriculum then. I learned how to
teach myself by reading books, watching screencasts and studying the work of
others. I also find that teaching others is a challenging and powerful way to
hone my understanding of a topic, I would like to do more of it in the future.
